HalloweenHouseScout
===================

A Windows Phone 8 application
Winner of UCSD's Windows Phone Halloween Application contest


A new way to Trick-or-Treat! HouseScout serves as your guide on the night
of the 31st, informing you which houses are participating by placing a green
or red house pin on a map. Register your own home from within the app to let
others know if you are giving out candy or not. HouseScout will show you a list
of houses near your current GPS location.
